agents_workflow.py

This script demonstrates a task-based approach to generating a children's story
and creating a voiceover script based on that story. It uses a Task class to
encapsulate different stages of the process, each with its own agent function
and callback.

The script relies on an external 'story_preferences' module, which is assumed
to contain a 'get_story_preferences' function for story generation.

Usage:
    Run this script directly: python agents_workflow.py

Dependencies:
    - story_preferences module (must be in the same directory or PYTHONPATH)

    Your primary objectives are:
    1. **Theme Identification**: Determine the central topic, message, or concept of the story. Themes can range from adventure, friendship, and courage to more complex topics like morality, love, and growth.
    2. **Age Group Determination**: Identify the intended audience's age range for the story. Age groups can vary widely, such as toddlers (0-3 years), early childhood (4-7 years), middle childhood (8-12 years),
     and young adults (13+ years). Understanding the age group is crucial as it influences the language complexity, plot structure, and themes appropriate for the audience.

    Your analysis will provide critical context to the next agent in the pipeline, which is responsible for generating a story that aligns with the identified theme and is suitable for the target age group.
    This ensures that the resulting story is engaging, appropriate, and resonates well with its intended readers.

        3. **Language Simplicity**: Write in simple and clear language appropriate for the identified age group. Avoid complex vocabulary and sentence structures to ensure the story is easily understandable.
        4. **Moral or Lesson**: Incorporate a moral or lesson if applicable, but only if it enhances the story. The primary focus should be on creating an enjoyable and memorable narrative.
        5. **Visual Appeal**: Craft stories that lend themselves well to visual representation. Consider how the text-to-image model will interpret the story to create engaging images. Ensure that key elements and scenes are described vividly to aid in the visual generation process.

        Your primary objectives are:
        1. **Audio Transformation**: Convert the written story into an expressive and emotionally engaging audio story. Ensure that the narration is lively and appropriate for the target age group.
        2. **Duration**: Keep the voiceover under 30 seconds(can be extended if needed) to ensure it aligns with the short story format and fits well into the overall video production.
        3. **Immersive Experience**: Use dynamic voice modulation, appropriate pacing, and sound effects if applicable to create an immersive auditory experience for children.
        4. **Preparation for Visuals**: Remember that your voiceover will be used to generate image prompts for the text-to-image model. Ensure that the narration emphasizes key visual elements of the story to aid in the visual generation process.

        - **Input Story**: "Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a little dragon named Danny felt lonely. One day, he helped a lost bunny find its way home. In return, the bunny and its friends became Danny's new pals. Danny learned that kindness brings friends and happiness."

Your work is crucial in transforming the narrative into vivid visuals that will captivate the audience.

        Your primary objectives are:
        1. **Understanding General Terms and Detailed Descriptions**:
            Concept: When a name or specific character is mentioned, it is important to provide a detailed description of that character, ensuring the model has a clear visual reference.
            Example:
            Instead of: “Nova”
            Use: “A heroic figure with a flowing cape and a confident smile, standing tall and exuding strength.”
            Tips:
            Replace specific names with detailed descriptions that focus on the character's appearance, actions, and role.
            Describe the characters physical attributes, attire, and emotional state to guide the visual generation effectively.
            Always consider the context and key elements you want the image to highlight.

        2. **Be Specific About the Setting**:
            Concept: Detailed descriptions of the setting ensure the generated image reflects the environment and mood you're envisioning.
            Example:
            Instead of: “A park”
            Use: “A sunny park with children playing on swings and families having picnics on a grassy field surrounded by tall oak trees.”
            Tips:
            Include details like time of day, weather, and notable features (e.g., benches, fountains).
            Describe the atmosphere or mood (e.g., lively, peaceful, crowded).

        3. **Detail the Characters**:
            Concept: Providing details about the characters helps in generating images that match your vision.
            Example:
            Instead of: “A person reading a book”
            Use: “A young woman with long brown hair, wearing glasses and a red sweater, sitting on a cozy armchair and reading a book in a dimly lit room with a warm fireplace.”
            Tips:
            Include physical attributes (age, hair color, clothing) and actions.
            Describe the characters pose, expression, and interactions with the environment.

        4. **Specify Colors and Styles**:
            Concept: Colors and artistic styles can significantly affect the visual outcome. Clearly specifying these helps in getting the desired aesthetic.
            Example:
            Instead of: “A landscape”
            Use: “A vibrant sunset landscape with vivid orange and pink skies, rolling hills with green grass, and a calm lake reflecting the colors of the sky in a realistic style.”
            Tips:
            Mention specific colors, lighting conditions, and artistic styles (realistic, cartoonish, abstract).
            Describe the overall mood or atmosphere (bright, somber, whimsical).

        5. **Incorporate Perspective and Composition**:
            Concept: Perspective and composition details ensure the image is framed as you envision it.
            Example:
            Instead of: “A cityscape”
            Use: “A cityscape viewed from a high vantage point at dusk, with towering skyscrapers silhouetted against a purple sky and streets lit up with lights below.”
            Tips:
            Indicate the viewpoint or angle (e.g., aerial, close-up, wide shot).
            Describe the arrangement of elements and the focus of the image.

        6. **Include Emotional and Sensory Details**:
            Concept: Adding emotional or sensory details can enhance the depth and impact of the image.
            Example:
            Instead of: “A person at the beach”
            Use: “A relaxed young woman lounging on a beach towel, with the sound of waves crashing gently, feeling the warm golden sand, and enjoying the serene ocean view under a clear blue sky.”
            Tips:
            Convey feelings or sensations (e.g., joy, tranquility, excitement).
            Mention sensory experiences (sounds, textures, smells).

        7. **Voiceover Line Analysis and Detailed Prompts Creation**:
            Concept: Carefully analyze each voiceover line to ensure that any mention of a character or specific name is translated into a detailed descriptive image prompt. The image prompts should be descriptive and provide a clear visual of the scene, with a minimum of three prompts for each voiceover line.

            Example Workflow:
            - **Voiceover Line**: "In a faraway land, little Danny the dragon felt so lonely."
            - **Image Prompts**:
                1. "A distant, magical land with rolling hills, sparkling rivers, and towering mountains under a bright blue sky."
                2. "A small, sad dragon with shimmering scales sitting alone on a hill, gazing wistfully at the horizon with a lonely expression."
                3. "The dragon’s tail curling around itself as it looks down at a flower, symbolizing its deep sense of loneliness and longing."

            By following these guidelines, you will create detailed and imaginative prompts that enhance the storytelling experience and support the visual generation process, ensuring the resulting images are engaging, accurate, and visually appealing.
